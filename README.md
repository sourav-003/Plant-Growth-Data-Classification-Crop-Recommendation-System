# 🌿 Plant Growth Data Classification – Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning project that predicts the most suitable crop based on key soil parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, and pH. This project is built to support **precision agriculture** by aligning crop selection with soil health to maximize yield and sustainability.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle to choose the right crop for their soil, leading to reduced yield and inefficient use of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven classification system that:
- Analyzes soil health parameters
- Recommends the most suitable crop
- Helps improve agricultural productivity and decision-making

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Performed EDA using **Sweetviz** and **Autoviz** to understand:
  - Soil nutrient distribution
  - Correlation among features
  - Crop class balance
- Identified Nitrogen and pH as key influential features

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sweetviz, Autoviz, PyCaret, Scikit-learn
- **Modeling Platform**: PyCaret (Classification Module)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Workflow

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- AutoML model comparison using PyCaret
- Selected **Random Forest Classifier** based on:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
- Tuned hyperparameters for best performance
- Visualized feature importance
- Tested on new, unseen soil data

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- ✅ High classification accuracy
- ✅ Well-balanced precision and recall
- ✅ Insightful feature importance chart
- ✅ Ready for deployment on real-world datasets

---

## 🧪 Final Output

The final model predicts suitable crops based on soil conditions, making it useful for:
- Agricultural consultants
- Farmers practicing smart farming
- AgriTech platforms aiming to provide crop advisory services

---

## 🌱 Impact

This project supports:
- Better **crop planning and decision-making**
- Reduced use of fertilizers by matching crop needs with soil conditions
- Promotion of **sustainable farming practices**
